Most of the objects are not modifiable on the quality or production systems, but we have exceptions like Infopackages on BW. Yesterday I have to check who deleted an object from the system and fortunately, there is the log for this operation. I will show you how to check this.

1. We have to go to the transaction SGL1 and search for RSSM

2. Now you should be able to find the impostor ðŸ™‚
