1. Firstly we have to move our table a few lines down. This can be done by moving the mouse between the table and toolbar and drag and dropping when the cursor changes the icon:
{{<figure align=center src="/sac_app_dropdown/1.png"  width="80%" >}}

2. Click on the plus icon on the toolbar
{{<figure align=center src="/sac_app_dropdown/2.png"  width="80%" >}}

3. Select Dropdown form the list 
{{<figure align=center src="/sac_app_dropdown/3.png"  width="80%" >}}

4. Lets rename the Table by click on tree dots -> Rename, and set new name to Table_Games_Sales
{{<figure align=center src="/sac_app_dropdown/5.png"  width="80%" >}}

5. Same with Dropdown, and put new name Dropdown_Name

{{<figure align=center src="/sac_app_dropdown/6.png"  width="80%" >}}

5. Find the fx icon near to the Canvas in the left panel and click on onInitialization

6. This will move us to the code editor where the party begins ðŸ’ƒ ðŸ•º but no worries, JavaScript in the SAC is very developer-friendly and restricted. It is very easy to learn - and you can hear this from me, an ABAP fanboy. If you want to learn more about JS in SAC, please check out the handbook [here](https://community.sap.com/topics/cloud-analytics/analytic-applications-api) (search for Developer Handbook)

7. Firstly we have to create a variable which will hold the content from our table

{{< highlight js >}}
var resultSet = Table_Games_Sales.getDataSource().getResultSet();
{{< /highlight >}}

8. Then we have to loop by the resultSet and assign all Names into our dropdown

{{< highlight js >}}
for ( var i = 0; i< resultSet.length; i++ ){		
	Dropdown_Name.addItem(resultSet[i]["Name"].id,resultSet[i]["Name"].description);		
}{{< /highlight >}}

<mark>If you want to fill the dropdown by data not included into your table (Table_Games_Sales) you should use getMembers()</mark>
{{< highlight js >}}
var resultSet = Table_Games_Sales.getDataSource().getMembers("Name");

for ( var i = 0; i< resultSet.length; i++ ){		
 Dropdown_Name.addItem(resultSet[i].id,resultSet[i].description);		
}{{< /highlight >}}

Nevertheless in this example will will stay with getResultSet(), because Name is available in our table and according to the [handbook](https://d.dam.sap.com/a/3Y16uka/SAPAnalyticsCloud_AnalyticsDesigner_DeveloperHandbook.pdf) this is better solution because of the performance

9. Ate the end our code should look like this 
{{<figure align=center src="/sac_app_dropdown/7.png"  width="80%" >}}

10. Now it is a time to save and run our app
{{<figure align=center src="/sac_app_dropdown/8.png"  width="80%" >}}

11. As you can see dropdown looks good, but it ends at "A" - this is because of the limitation. Our file contain much more games.
{{<figure align=center src="/sac_app_dropdown/9.png"  width="80%" >}}

Easies way to fix this is to create a additional filter on Publisher and make them cascading, but this will be described in the next post. </br>

12. Dropdown is filled, bu it is not working - not filtering any values in the table. To enable this, lest go back to the editor, and click on fx near to Dropdown_Name

{{<figure align=center src="/sac_app_dropdown/10.png"  width="80%" >}}

13. There is only one event - onSelect. In the code we need to get the selection from dropdown and set up a filter. Lets assign key to the new variable, and then use setDimentionFilter to put a filter.

{{< highlight js >}}
var selectedName = Dropdown_Name.getSelectedKey();
Table_Games_Sales.getDataSource().setDimensionFilter("Name",selectedName);
{{< /highlight >}}

{{<figure align=center src="/sac_app_dropdown/12.png"  width="80%" >}}

14. Please check your app. Dropdown Filter should work fine now. I have a bit different layout but no worries. I will explain how to do it step by step in my nex post.
