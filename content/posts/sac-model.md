Let's build a very simple SAC model using kaggle data on video game sales.

1. To create a model on SAC, firstly you have to login into your account (please search for trail if necessary). Next click on files, plus icon, and select model.

7. This model is very simple so we don't have to change anything. Just click on Create Model

It is done ðŸ˜Ž Now you can use it in the next steps or your own project. Please notice that in the case of more complex datasets before saving you would have to clean the data, assign keys and descriptions or provide additional calculations.
