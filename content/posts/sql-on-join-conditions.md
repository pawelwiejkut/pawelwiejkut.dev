Even if you use SQL for your daily work, it is possible that you might donâ€™t know about two ways to set a condition: using "where" and .. put the condition into the join. The main issue is that they can return different results. Let me explain more.

1.Letâ€™s assume that you have 2 tables. Content of first one

2.Content of the second one
<img src="/sql_on_join_conditions/2.png" width="80%" />

3. Now letâ€™s get only this employees with salary bigger than 4 000
{{< highlight sql >}}
select * from employees emp left join salaries sal on emp.id = sal.employee
where sal.salary > 4000
{{< /highlight >}}

4. Result shouldnâ€™t impress anyone

5. But now letâ€™s change our query and move the condition to ON. Results will look different than before
<img src="/sql_on_join_conditions/4.png" width="80%" />


6. Of course, this behavior is correct and refers to the algebra of the relationship used in SQL. I have to paste here my favorite image

7. So as you see our statement without any restriction should return
<img src="/sql_on_join_conditions/6.png" width="80%" />


and because we just have only one entry which passes our criteria we just get empty rows in other cases. This also explains why our condition move doesnâ€™t change anything in case of an inner join

If you created a infoset object on SAP BW System, you can see that there is an option called Left Outer: Add Filter Value to On-Condition.
<img src="/sql_on_join_conditions/9.png" width="80%" />


When you donâ€™t check this option, evaluated SQL for ASE DB in my case will look like below
{{< highlight sql >}}
select
"T1"."TCTSYSID"  as "F1"
, "T1"."TCTJOBNAME"  as "F2"
from
"/BI0/ATCTHP24O00" "T1"
join
"/BI0/ATCT_O4100" "T2"
on
"T1" . "TCTSYSID"
= "T2" . "TCTSYSID"
join
"/BI0/ATCTHP24O00" "T3"
on
"T1" . "TCTSYSID"
= "T3" . "TCTSYSID"
where
( ( ( ( ( (
"T1"."TCTSYSID"
= 'NPLCLNT100'
) ) ) ) AND  ( ( ( (
"T1"."CALDAY"
= '20190414'
) ) ) ) ) )
group by
"T1"."TCTSYSID"
,"T1"."TCTJOBNAME"
order by
"F1" ASC
, "F2" ASC
plan '
(use optgoal sap_olap)
(use fact_table T3)
(use parallel 4)
(prop T3 (parallel 4))
'
/* BW-SYS-DB-SYB:I */
{{< /highlight >}}

And when we check flag:
{{< highlight sql >}}
select
"T1"."TCTSYSID"  as "F1"
, "T1"."TCTJOBNAME"  as "F2"
from
"/BI0/ATCTHP24O00" "T1"
join
"/BI0/ATCT_O4100" "T2"
on
"T1" . "TCTSYSID"
= "T2" . "TCTSYSID"
join
"/BI0/ATCTHP24O00" "T3"
on
"T1" . "TCTSYSID"
= "T3" . "TCTSYSID"
where
( ( ( ( ( (
"T1"."TCTSYSID"
= 'NPLCLNT100'
) ) ) ) AND  ( ( ( (
"T1"."CALDAY"
= '20190414'
) ) ) ) ) )
group by
"T1"."TCTSYSID"
,"T1"."TCTJOBNAME"
order by
"F1" ASC
, "F2" ASC
plan '
(use optgoal sap_olap)
(use fact_table T3)
(use parallel 4)
(prop T3 (parallel 4))
'
{{< /highlight >}}
