Is is still possible to install/sideload iOS apps into M1 Mac? Answer is yes - it is possible even on the newest version of MacOS (Monterey 12.0.1).<mark>Nevertheless you have to know that not all applications are working well</mark>. In example Instagram is crashing every time at startup, and you have to clear ~/Library/Containers/Instagram every time before launch.
