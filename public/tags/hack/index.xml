I prepared myself, user, without authorization to the db02 transaction. When I want to run this transaction, I get a message: ‚ÄûYou are not authorized to use transaction‚Äù
Go to the SE37 transaction, and display function module: AUTH_CHECK_TCODE.
Now seat a breakpoint on line 28, where sy-subrc is checked (in new versions line 53).</description>
